<item><b>Touch Test</b> is a simple Android app to test screen parameters
and multi-touch.  It shows display parameters, multiple touch points,
and trails.  This app is intended to be of use to people bringing up new
devices, but may be of interest to others.\n\
\n\
Touch Test is an open-source app; you can get the source code through the
project page.  See the \"More Information\" section.</item>
			  
<item>The app displays a number of features designed to help with screen
and touch setup:\n\
\n\
• The text near the top-left shows the display size in pixels,
the current reported device orientation from the configuration info,
and the reported display orientation.\n\
\n\
• There is a 1-pixel border around the edge of the screen, and a set of
triangles whose points are at the exact edge of the screen.  These can be
used to check that the display driver is mapping the frame buffer to the
LCD correctly, and that the LCD is positioned correctly under the display
bezel.  (Useful for people bringing up new devices.)\n\
\n\
• A 50-pixel grid is drawn in blue.\n\
\n\
• The active pointers are drawn in different colours, both as circles marking
the position, and crosshairs so it can be seen while the finger is there.\n\
\n\
• Pointers are drawn in grey when no longer active, so you can see where
they landed.\n\
\n\
• Trails are drawn showing the last 200 or so points reported by each
pointer.  These can be used to check the linearity of the touch panel.\n\
\n\
Note that the app can only show pointers (i.e. fingers) that are reported
by the OS and hardware.  If you only see one or two active fingers, don\'t
blame the app – that\'s what your device supports.  In particular, Android
versions before 2.0 only support single-touch.\n\
\n\
On some devices, when you touch with two fingers and rotate them, you will
see that the app reports your fingers in the wrong places.  Again, this
is a hardware limitation.  Some touchpanels can detect two fingers, but
only in terms of corners of a square.  In other words, the panel can
detect that there are fingers at X co-ordinates 100 and 400, and at Y
co-ordinates 200 and 600; but they can\'t tell you whether the first
finger is at 100,200 or 400,200.  In this case, Android takes its best
guess at which corners of the square the fingers are actually at.  This is
not actually a problem, as pinch-to-zoom will still work fine.</item>

<item>The device\'s \"menu\" button pops up a menu containing a number
of options:\n\
• <b>Help</b> displays this help.\n\
• <b>About</b> displays an about box, with links to the license and
the project home page, where you can get the source code.\n\
• <b>Exit</b> stops the application.</item>
